# A-Star-Java-Implementation
A* also called A Star, algorithm java implementation

This is a java implementation of the A Star algorithm.

The implementation includes 3 files:
  - AStar.java : Original algorithm class.
  - AStarOrthogonal.java : Only allows movement on the horizontal/vertical axis (no diagonal), and incurs and cost penalty when changing directions.
  - Node.java : Class for the nodes used by the algorithm.
  - Orthogonal.java : Enum for horizontal and vertical
  - AStarTest.java : Class with a main method and a simple test for the algorithm implementation
